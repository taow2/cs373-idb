This cluster examines the actions of Miami Heat supporters and attention received by popular Heat players.

The first graph displays trend lines for a number of hashtags that signify support for the Heat.  All of the hashtags are correlated with the others and show a very similar pattern.  The first upward surge in the trend lines reflects the final games of the playoffs before the Finals.  The second surge reflects the NBA Finals themselves.  Each trend line trails off once the season finishes.

The second graph displays trend lines for some of the Heat's more popular players, including Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, and LeBron James.  Furthermore, a trend line for #NBAFinals was included as a reference.  The interesting thing about this graph is the contrast between LeBron James's data and his teammates' data.  Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade both received attention that follows the same pattern attention for the Heat as a team, spiking first for the final playoff games and again for the NBA Finals.  James's data does rise during the finals, but spikes a full week after its conclusion.  This contrast reveals that the majority of interest in LeBron James is not closely tied to the fact that he plays for the Heat.  In fact, there seems to be an entirely separate but still cohesive group that is interested in the player's personal journey through his professional basketball career, regardless of the team he plays for.
