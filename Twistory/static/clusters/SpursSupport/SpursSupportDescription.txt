This cluster examines the actions of San Antonio Spurs supporters and attention received by individual players and the Spurs coach, Gregg Popovich.

The first graph shows data tracking general support for the Spurs in the form of several related hashtags.  Of note is the hashtag #beattheheat which, while correlated with the other tags in the graph, behaves somewhat differently early on in the graph.  This difference is a reflection of the pre-finals games of the NBA Playoffs.

The second graph shows data tracking the attention received by individuals within the Spurs organization.  This data reveals two separate kinds of attention received by team members.  The first kind is that received by the already popular players Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, and Tim Duncan, who all received significant attention before the series began and maintained consistently high attention throughout the finals.   The second kind is that received by the younger player Kawhi Leonard and Spurs coach Gregg Popovich.  Missing out on games 1 and 2, Kawhi Leonard appeared in the rest of the series and made a powerful impression, leading the Spurs in points scored in each of the games he played as well as eventually being named Finals MVP.  His rise in popularity in the middle of the series went hand-in-hand with Gregg Popovich becoming a major topic of conversation, suggesting that the popularity of a coach is more tied to the making and successes of unexpected decisions than to the overall success of the team.
