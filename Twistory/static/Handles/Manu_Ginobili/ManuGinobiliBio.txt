Coming from a family of professional basketball players, he is a member of the Argentine men's national basketball team and the San Antonio Spurs in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

He is one of only two players, along with Bill Bradley, to have won a Euroleague title, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal.[2]

Ginóbili spent the early part of his basketball career in Argentina and Italy, where he won several individual and team honors.

In the 2007–08 season, he was named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year. Ginóbili has also enjoyed success with the Argentina national team.
